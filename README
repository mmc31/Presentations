This repository contains files related to presentations I've given.

defense.pdf is the most up to date presentation I've given on my research. 
It uses both .avi files, which may not run properly depending on how your .pdf viewer accepts embedded videos.

fri_vis.pdf is a simplified talk which omits most of the math behind the research, and gives an overview.
It uses only one of the .avi files.
